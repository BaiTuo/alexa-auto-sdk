# Alexa Auto Core Engine for Android

## Introduction

The [AAC SDK](https://github.com/alexa/aac-sdk/) is a native library which wraps the AVS Device SDK, and provides a simplified, and unified API for using AVS along with automotive specific features. 

For the Android platform, the AAC SDK is wrapped by a JNI layer which mirrors the native C++ API. This layer is built into the `aace` Android library project. You can view it by opening `${AAC_SDK_HOME}/platforms/android` in Android Studio.

This document refers to the Java API classes.
